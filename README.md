# Shopping Cart Assessment
This is the first group assignment in the OOD Course at NEU in FALL 2023.
We are given a 20$ bill.
WE have to craete an Item class.
Inside the Item class we have created a demo method which creates objects of Item class.
The objects created using demo method of Item class have 2 attributes -> name and price.
Inside the dmeo method we are calculating the change remaining after cashing out the objects from the 20$ bill.
At the end we print the items bought, it's prices along with the change and the date and time of purchase.
